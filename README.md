# SUMMARY

CBICall (**C**NAG **B**iomedical **I**nformatics framework for variant **Call**ing) is a computational pipeline designed for variant calling analysis using Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data.

# INSTALLATION

## From GitHub

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/mrueda/cbicall.git
    cd cbicall

Install `cpanminus` (analog to Python's `pip`) and GNU compilers:

    sudo apt install cpanminus gcc

We will install the dependencies at `~/perl5`:

    cpanm --local-lib=~/perl5 local::lib && eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -Mlocal::lib)
    cpanm --notest --installdeps .

To ensure Perl recognizes your local modules every time you start a new terminal, you should type:

    echo 'eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc

If only need to update do:

    git pull

Optional, peform tests:

    prove -l

Install dependencies for Python 3:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Finally, navigate to a directory where you want the databases stored and execute:

    python3 $path_to_cbicall/scripts/01_download_external_data.py  # Replace $path_to_cbicall with your CBICall installation path.

Note: Google Drive can be a tad restrictive with the download. If you get an error, please use the error URL link in a browser and you should be able to retrieve it there.

Once downloaded, perform a checksum to make sure the files were not corrupted:

    md5sum -c data.tar.gz.md5

Now let's reassemble the split files into the original tar archive:

    cat data.tar.gz.part-?? > data.tar.gz

Clean up split files to save space (when you think you are ready!):

    rm data.tar.gz.part-??

Extract the tar archive:

    tar -xzvf data.tar.gz

Finally, in the `cbicall` repo: 

Change `DATADIR` variable in `workflows/bash/parameters.sh` and `workflows/snakemake/config.yaml` so that it matches the location of your downloaded data.

Ok, finally we are going to install `Java 8` in case you don't have it already:

    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

# HOW TO RUN CBICALL

CBICall execution requires:

- Input Files

    A folder containing Paired-End FASTQ files (e.g., `MA00001_exome/MA0000101P_ex/*{R1,R2}*fastq.gz`).

    You have a `examples/input/` directory with input data that you can use for testing.

- Parameters File

    A YAML-formatted parameters file controlling pipeline execution.

Below are the parameters that can be customized, along with their default values. Parameters must be separated from their values by whitespace or tabs.

## Essential Parameters

    mode:            single  
    pipeline:        wes          
    sample:          undef        
    workflow_engine:   bash

## Optional Parameters (Currently Unused)

    capture:         Agilent SureSelect  
    genome:          hg19                
    organism:        Homo Sapiens        
    technology:      Illumina HiSeq      

CBICall will create a dedicated project directory (`cbicall_*`) to store analysis outputs. This design allows multiple independent runs concurrently without modifying original input files.

Below is a detailed description of key parameters:

- **mode**

    Two modes are supported: `single` (default, for individual samples) and `cohort` (for family-based or small cohort analyses).

- **pipeline**

    Specifies the analysis pipeline. Currently available options: `wes` (whole-exome sequencing) and `mit` (mitochondrial DNA analysis). Note: to run `cohort` analysis, first complete a `single` analysis for each sample.

- **sample**

    Path (relative or absolute) to the directory containing FASTQ files for analysis. See the `examples` directory for detailed guidance.

    Example:

    examples/input/CNAG999\_exome/CNAG99901P\_ex

- **workflow\_engine**

    Supported workflow engines: `bash` or `snakemake`.

## Example Commands

    $ bin/cbicall -p param_file.yaml -t 8
    $ bin/cbicall -p param_file.yaml -t 4 -verbose
    $ bin/cbicall -p param_file.yaml -t 16 > log 2>&1
    $ $path_to_cbicall/bin/cbicall -p param_file.yaml -t 8 -debug 5

Note: For Trio analyses, unique (de novo) variant rates for probands typically should be ~1%, and ~10% for parents. Significant deviations may indicate issues.

## ADDENDUM: Nomenclature Guidelines

All parts must follow a strict character count, and everything after the underscore is mandatory.

## Directory Naming

- Format: `[ProjectCode]_[SampleType]`

    - - `ProjectCode`: Exactly 7 characters \[a-zA-Z0-9\] (e.g., `MA99999`)
    - - `SampleType`: Must be `exome` (5 characters)

    Example:

        MA99999_exome

    Total: 7 + 1 + 5 = 13 characters.

## File Naming

- Format: `[ProjectCode][SampleID][Role]_[SampleTypeShort]`

    - - `ProjectCode`: 7 characters (\[a-zA-Z0-9\] e.g., `MA99999`)
    - - `SampleID`: 2 characters (e.g., `01`)
    - - `Role`: 1 character (e.g., `P` for Proband, `F` for Father, `M` for Mother)
    - - `SampleTypeShort`: Must be `ex` (2 characters)

    Example:

        MA9999901F_ex

    Total: 7 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 13 characters (excluding any file extension).

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

CBICall is optimized for multi-core Linux desktop, workstation, or server environments. Snakemake-based workflows can also be adapted for HPC clusters.

Recommended specifications:

    * Works in amd64 and arm64 archs (M-based Macs).
    * Ideally a Debian-based distribution (Ubuntu or Mint), but any other (e.g., CentOS, OpenSUSE) should do as well (untested).
    * >= 8 GB RAM.
    * >= 4 CPU cores (Intel i7 or Xeon preferred).
    * >= 250 GB HDD space.
    * Perl >= 5.10 and required CPAN modules (install via C<cpanm --notest --installdeps .>).
    * Java 8 (install via C<sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk>).
    * Snakemake (install via C<pip3 install -r requirements.txt>).

Perl scripts in CBICall have minimal RAM usage (~2% of 16 GB system). However, genome mapping tasks benefit significantly from higher memory availability. GATK and Picard default to 8 GB RAM allocations, configurable by users as needed.

Parallel execution is supported but does not scale linearly. Optimal performance is achieved using 4 threads per task. For example, with 12 cores, running three tasks in parallel with 4 cores each is typically more efficient than one task with all 12 cores.

Unit/integration tests are conducted manually by verifying CSV and VCF outputs against established test datasets.

# COMMON ERRORS AND TROUBLESHOOTING

- GATK Errors (wes\_single.sh or wes\_cohort.sh)
    - Error: `NaN LOD value assigned` in recalibration steps.

        Occurs due to insufficient INDEL variants (typically fewer than 8000) for negative model training. The default threshold is 8000.

        Solution: Increase minimum INDEL count (e.g., to >8000) in relevant pipeline scripts. Only rerun failed samples.

    - Error: `there aren't enough columns for line ... dbsnp_137.hg19.vcf`

        Solution: Remove the problematic line from the VCF file and document changes in a README file.
- **MTOOLBOX Errors**

    \- Failure related to unsupported N\_CIGAR:  
      Add flag `--filter_reads_with_N_cigar` in Mtoolbox.sh (line ~386).

    \- Samples with coverage below ~10x yield unreliable heteroplasmy fractions (HF). Extremely low coverage (<10x) can render HFs meaningless, despite generally consistent results across widely varying coverage levels.
